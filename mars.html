        <h1>Mars</h1>
        <p>Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood.
            Egyptians called it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one."

        <h2>Orbit</h2>
        <p>
            Mars completes its rotation on its axis every 24.6 hours, making a Martian day only 0.7 hours longer than an Earth day. 
            These Martian days are referred to as "sols," which is short for solar days.
            A year on Mars is significantly longer than a year on Earth, lasting approximately 687 Earth days or about 669.6 sols.
        </p>
        <p>
            The planet follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun, which leads to uneven lengths of the seasons.
            Due to this elliptical orbit, autumn in the southern hemisphere of Mars is the longest season, 
            while spring is the shortest. Winter and fall tend to be longer compared to the other seasons as well.

        <h2>Formation:</h2>
        <p>
            Mars formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, when gravity drew together gas and dust to create the planet.
            It is about half the size of Earth and is composed of a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid, thin outer crust.
            The planet's core is estimated to be about 1,170 miles thick. 
            the crust ranges from 6 to 30 miles deep and is made up of elements such as iron, potassium, aluminum, calcium, and magnesium

    <div class="info-card">
        <h2>Surface</h2>
        <p>
           Mars is known for its redish color, which comes from the oxidation of iron in its rocks.
           This iron-rich dust gets lifted into the atmosphere, giving the planet a reddish appearance when viewed from afar. 
           The Martian soil contains a variety of elements that create hues of gold, red, brown, and tan. 
           One of Mars' most dramatic features is the Valles Marineris canyon system, 
           which is over 3,000 miles longâ€”stretching the equivalent distance from California to New York. 
           Mars also boasts Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system. 
           It stands three times taller than Mount Everest and has a base about the size of New Mexico. 
           Geological features on Mars suggest that the planet experienced massive floods around 3.5 billion years ago. 
           Today, water exists on Mars mostly in the form of frozen saltwater.

    <h2>Atmosphere:</h2>
    <p>Mars has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, 
        with smaller amounts of nitrogen and argon. 
        This thin atmosphere provides little protection from meteorites and asteroids. 
        Temperature variations on Mars are extreme,
        it can reach as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) during the day and 
        can drop as low as -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius) at night.
