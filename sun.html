        <h1>Sun</h1>
        <p>
            The sun is the centerpiece of the solar system keeping everything together within its gravitational pull. Keeping large planets and satellites in orbit. 
            The sun is the earth's drive behind it’s seasons and climate , ocean currents, weather, radiation and auroras.

        <h3>Namesake</h3>
        <p>
            The sun has many names across cultures, the latin word for sun is Sol, which is the main adjective for all things sun related: Solar.

        <h2>How a Star is formed </h2>
        <h3>Birth of a star</h3>
        <p>Stars form in large clouds of gas and dust,
            they can an range from 1,000 to 10 million times the mass of the sun. 
            Molecular clouds are cold enough for clouds to condense into high density pockets. 
            As they collide into each other, collect more strength and matter, gravity pulls the particles in and they collapse into a protostar.  
            Batches of stars have recently formed, called stellar cluster. 
            Stars for from a process called nuclear fusion, 
            after millions of years, immense pressures and temperatures in the star’s core squeeze the nuclei of hydrogen atoms together to form helium.

        <h3>Development of a Star</h3>
        <p>
            Main sequence stars are stably undergoing nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. 
            The star’s gas provides fuel, it’s mass determine how fast it runs through its supply. 
            Massive stars burn out faster, due to the procedure taking more fuel to keep from collapsing under its own gravity. 
            Low mass stars can shine for trillions of years, while some massive stars will only last a few million years
        </p>

        <h3>Death of a star </h3>
        <p>
            After all of the gas is burnt out, the sun will turn into a dwarf star
            The dwarf star is the ramming core of the star
            Fusion converts carbon into heavier elements like oxygen, neon, and magnesium, which will become future fuel for the core. 
            For the largest stars, this chain continues until silicon fuses into iron. 
            By the time silicon fuses into iron, the star runs out of fuel in a matter of days.
            The star becomes either a neutron star or a black hole

        <h2>About our sun:</h2>
        <h3>formation</h3>
        <p>Made of ionized gas called plasma 
            Earth is a part of the sun’s solar system
            Earth is about 93 million miles from the sun
            The sun’s core is about 27 million degrees fahrenheit
            The sun’s diameter  is about 100 times bigger than the earth 
            The sun is currently in the middle of its life cycle, is considered to be a yellow giant 
            The sun formed in about 4.5 billion years, 
            in roughly 5 billion years , the sun will become a red giant 
            The sun's final stage is a white dwarf             
        </p>
        <h3>Life</h3>
        <p>The sun and life on earth
            Heat for the sun creates a warm climate for life to develop on. 
            There earth is within the right sweet spot for life to grow and develop, if it were closer it would be to close
