        <h2>Orbit</h2>
        <p>
           Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, orbiting at an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (19 astronomical units). 
           Its diameter measures about 31,763 miles (51,118 kilometers), making it roughly four times wider than Earth. 
           It takes sunlight approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes to reach Uranus. 
           A single day on Uranus lasts about 17 Earth hours, while one complete orbit around the Sun takes 84 Earth years. <br>
           Uranus is unique beacue it's 97.77 degrees axial tilt, which causes it to rotate almost sideways.
           Uranus's tilt cause the sun to shine directly one it poles.
           in addition, The planet has a distinctive magnetic field that is significantly tilted, nearly 60 degrees off from its rotational axis.

        <h2>Formation:</h2>
        <p>
            Uranus formed about 4.5 billion years ago as part of the outer solar system's development. 
            It is one of the two ice giants (along with Neptune) and is composed mostly of icy materials like water, methane, and ammonia, with a small rocky core. 
            Near the core, temperatures can rise up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius). 
            Despite being larger in diameter than Neptune, Uranus is the second least dense planet in the solar system.
            Uranus also has two sets of rings: the inner nine are narrow and dark gray, while the outer two include one reddish and one blue ring, similar in appearance to Saturn’s E-ring.

        <h2>Surface</h2>
        <p>
            Uranus doesn’t have a solid surface like Earth. Instead, it is composed mostly of swirling fluids. 
            This makes it impossible for a spacecraft to land or pass through the planet without being crushed or damaged by its dense atmosphere and high-pressure environment. 
            Its gaseous and icy layers conceal a small rocky core deep within.

    <h2>Atmosphere:</h2>
    <p>
        The atmosphere of Uranus is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with small amounts of methane, water, and ammonia.
        Methane gas in the upper atmosphere absorbs red wavelengths of sunlight and reflects  the planet's distinct blue
        Uranus exhibits some fascinating weather features. 
        As it approaches equinox, dynamic clouds begin to form, including rapidly changing bright spots. 
        Voyager 2 revealed two major storm systems, a Great Dark Spot and a smaller dark spot, in 1986. 
        The planet has extremely low temperatures, with a minimum of about 49 K (−224.2°C), making it the coldest atmosphere in the solar system. 
        Wind speeds can reach up to 560 miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour).
        Uranus also has auroras, though they are not aligned with the poles, due to the planet’s highly tilted and off-centered magnetic field.
