    <h2>Orbit</h2>
    <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun, with an average distance of about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles). 
        It is one of Earth's closest neighbors and appears as the third brightest object in the sky, 
        visible as both the "morning star" and "evening star" depending on the time of year.
        One year on Venus, its orbital period around the Sun, lasts 225 Earth days. 
        However, a single rotation on its axis (a day) takes 243 Earth days, making a Venusian day longer than its year. 
        The planet has a diameter of about 7,521 miles (12,033 km).

    <h2>Formation</h2>
    <p>
        Venus formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, alongside the rest of the solar system, as gravity pulled together gas and dust. 
        It developed a layered structure with a large metallic core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust. 
        The crust is estimated to be about 250 miles (400 kilometers) thick.

<div class="info-card">
    <h2>Surface</h2>
    <p>
        In its early history, Venus likely had oceans and rivers similar to early Earth. 
        Today, its surface is shaped by volcanic activity driven by molten lava beneath its crust. 
        The planet has a thin, rocky outer shell and a hot, rocky mantle. 
        Shifting tectonic plates contribute to the formation of volcanoes and mountain ranges.
    </p>

<div class="info-card">
    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. 
        Winds reach speeds of up to 360 kilometers per hour (224 mph), and the cloud layer remains stable in these high-speed winds. 
        At altitudes about 50 kilometers above the surface, temperatures range from 86 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit (30 to 70 degrees Celsius), 
        and the clouds block ultraviolet radiation.
