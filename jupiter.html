        <h2>Orbit</h2>
        <p>
        Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with an average distance of about 484 million miles from the Sun. 
        It is an enormous gas giant, measuring roughly 11 times wider than Earth. 
        Due to its immense size and distance from the Sun, it takes sunlight approximately 43 minutes to reach Jupiter’s upper atmosphere. 
        Jupiter also holds the record for the shortest day of any planet in the solar system, completing a full rotation on its axis in just 9.9 hours. 
        Its axis is tilted by only 3 degrees, which means the planet does not experience noticeable seasonal changes.  
        </p>

        <h2>Formation:</h2>
        <p>
            Jupiter formed around 4.6 billion years ago, at the same time as the rest of the solar system. 
            Its formation began as gravity pulled together swirling gas and dust, eventually creating this massive gas giant. 
            The planet likely consists mainly of hydrogen and helium gases, with a small core made of rock, ice, and metal. 
            However, recent data from NASA's Juno mission suggests that the core may be "dissolved" in the surrounding liquid hydrogen, 
            making it difficult to define where the core begins or ends. 
            Jupiter is also home to the largest ocean in the solar system, made not of water, but of compressed liquid hydrogen. 
            This ocean, combined with the planet’s rapid rotation, generates a powerful magnetic field. 
            Additionally, Jupiter has a faint ring system, which was discovered by NASA’s Voyager 1 mission. 
            These rings are made up of dark particles and are very difficult to see unless backlit by the Sun.

        <h2>Surface</h2>
        <p>
           As a gas giant, Jupiter does not have a solid surface like Earth or Mars. 
           Instead, the planet’s outer layer is made up of dense clouds of gas that gradually transition into its liquid interior. 
           There is no clear boundary between the atmosphere and the interior, making the concept of a “surface” more theoretical than actual. 
        </p>
    </div>

<div class="info-card">
    <h2>Atmosphere:</h2>
    <p>
        Jupiter’s atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with striking bands of colorful clouds made of ammonia and water. 
        These swirling clouds form the planet’s signature striped appearance, where the darker regions are known as "belts" and the lighter regions are called "zones." 
        The atmosphere is highly dynamic, with strong winds and massive storms, 
        the most famous being the Great Red Spot—a gigantic storm system larger than Earth that has been raging for centuries.

    <h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
    <p>
        Jupiter has 95 officially recognized moons, making it a miniature solar system in its own right. 
        Some of these moons, like Europa, have captured scientists’ attention due to the potential for life. 
        Europa is believed to have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust,  
        making it one of the most promising places in the solar system to search for extraterrestrial life.
