            Mercury is the first planet from the sun. 
            Named after the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods, a fitting title for the fastest planet in our solar system. 
            It completes a full orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days, racing through space at remarkable speed.

        <h2>Namesake</h2>
        <p>Mercury is named after the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods, 
            a fitting title for the fastest planet in our solar system. 
            It completes a full orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days, 
            racing through space at remarkable speed.

    <div class="info-card">
        <h2>Orbit</h2>
        <p>
            As the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury follows an elongated, egg-shaped orbit. 
            It travels at an average speed of 29 miles per second. 
            The planet’s distance from the Sun ranges from about 29 million miles at its closest point (perihelion) 
            to 43 million miles at its farthest (aphelion). 
            a planets orbit orbital period, around the sun is considered a year, while rotation on it's axis is considered it day.
            Mercury's year is 88 Earth days, while its rotation on its axis takes 176 Earth days. 
            The planet is tilted only 2 degrees on its axis, resulting in minimal seasonal variation. 
            Interestingly, due to its unusual rotation and orbital patterns, Mercury can appear to rise, set, and then rise again briefly in the same day when viewed from some locations. 
            Although Venus is closer to Earth in average distance, Mercury actually spends more time in Earth’s proximity over the course of its orbit.

        <h2>Formation:</h2>
        <p>
            Mercury formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, when gravity drew together gas and dust in the early solar system. 
            The planet eventually developed a layered structure, consisting of a large metallic core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.
            Mercury's core has a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,075 km), while its crust is estimated to be around 250 miles (400 km) thick.

    <div class="info-card">
        <h2>Surface:</h2>
        <p>
            Mercury’s surface bears a strong resemblance to that of Earth’s Moon,
            covered with craters formed by countless asteroid impacts over billions of years. 
            In the planet's polar regions, particularly within permanently shadowed craters, scientists have detected the presence of frozen water. 
            The surface material also contains tiny particles from crushed rock that reflect sunlight, 
            contributing to the planet's unique brightness.

<div class="info-card">
    <h2>Atmosphere:</h2>
    <p>
        Mercury has an exosphere of dust and debris from meteorite impacts 
        Exosphere consist of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium and potassium 
        Lack of atmosphere leads to drastic temperature changes 
        Temperatures change from 800 degrees in the day to -290 degrees celsius in the night
