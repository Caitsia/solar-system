        <p>
            Saturn is named after the Roman god of architecture, wealth, and time, who was also considered the father of Jupiter in Roman mythology. 
            This naming reflects Saturn’s prominence and its close association with Jupiter in the planetary lineup.      </p>

        <h2>Orbit</h2>
        <p>
            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, located approximately 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers) or about 9.5 astronomical units away. 
            Astronomical units are based on the earth's distance from the sun.
            It has a diameter of roughly 74,897 miles (120,500 kilometers), making it the second largest planet in our solar system, next to Jupiter.
            A day on Saturn, its rotation period, lasts only about 10.7 Earth hours.
            while a full orbit around the Sun (a Saturnian year) takes about 29.4 Earth years.
            The axial tilt of Saturn is 26.73 degrees, which contributes to is seasonal changes.
            Roughly 146 known moons orbit saturn, ranging in size and compostion. 
            Saturn has the most moons out of all in the solar system.

        <h2>Formation:</h2>
        <p>
            Saturn formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, the gas and dust created the rest of the solar system.
            Around 4 billion years ago, saturn had settled into the orbital pattern that it's in today, 
            One of Saturn’s most iconic features is its complex ring system, which is arranged from the planet outward as follows: 
            the D ring, C ring, B ring, the Cassini Division, A ring, F ring, G ring, and finally the E ring.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-card">
        <h2>Surface</h2>
        <p>
            As a gas giant, Saturn lacks a true solid surface. It is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. 
            At its core, Saturn is believed to contain dense metals such as iron and nickel, surrounded by rocky material. 
            The core is enveloped within dense metalic liquid hydrogen, engulfed in liquid hydrogen.
            satrens adverage density is lower that liquid water, meaning it would float in a larger enough body of water.
        </p>
        <p>
            Saturn’s powerful magnetic field interacts with its rings, drawing in material and contributing to phenomena such as aurorae, 
            which occur when charged particles spiral along magnetic field lines into the atmosphere.

    <h2>Atmosphere:</h2>
    <p>
        The atmosphere of Saturn is blanketed in bands of clouds, which appear as subtle shades of yellow, brown, and grey. 
        These faint stripes are caused by varying compositions and temperatures in the upper atmosphere. 
        Winds at the cloud tops can reach astonishing speeds of 1,600 feet per second (500 meters per second), far surpassing wind speeds on Earth. 
        The pressure on Saturn increases dramatically with depth and can reach levels comparable to those found deep underwater on Earth. 
        Saturn’s overall power output, including internal heat, is about 578 times greater than Earth’s, contributing to its dynamic atmospheric activity.
