        <h2>Orbit</h2>
        <p>
            Neptune, the eighth planet from the Sun, has a day that lasts about 16 Earth hours. 
            A full orbit around the Sun takes roughly 165 Earth years. 
            Interestingly, due to Pluto’s highly elliptical orbit, Pluto occasionally comes closer to the Sun than Neptune for a period of about 20 years in its 248-year orbit.
            Tilted at 28 degrees, Neptune experiences seasonal changes, though each season lasts over 40 Earth years due to the planet's long orbit. 
            Neptune is accompanied by 16 known moons, with its largest, Triton, discovered just 17 days after Neptune itself in 1846. 
            Triton is unique—it’s the only large moon in the solar system that orbits in the opposite direction of its planet’s rotation, suggesting it may have been captured by Neptune’s gravity. 
            Triton is also incredibly cold, with surface temperatures around −391°F (−235°C).

        <h2>Formation:</h2>
        <p>
            Neptune formed about 4.5 billion years ago alongside the rest of the solar system. 
            Scientists believe it originally developed closer to the Sun before slowly migrating outward to its current position.

    <div class="info-card">
        <h2>Surface</h2>
        <p>
            As an ice giant, Neptune is composed mostly of gas and liquids, with no solid surface. 
            However, it is believed to have a solid core about the same mass as Earth. <br>
            Beneath its cloud layers, there may be an ocean of hot water, kept in a strange high-pressure state. 
            Neptune’s magnetic field is unusual—it is tilted about 47 degrees from its rotational axis and is offset from the planet’s center. 
            Despite its lopsided shape, Neptune's magnetic field is extremely strong—around 27 times more powerful than Earth’s.

    <h2>Atmosphere:</h2>
    <p>
        Neptune’s atmosphere is made primarily of hydrogen and helium, with small amounts of methane. 
        Like Uranus, the methane absorbs red wavelengths of sunlight, giving Neptune its signature rich blue hue. 
        The atmosphere blends gradually into a layer of superheated water and melted ices below, with no clear boundary between the two. <br>
        The Voyager 2 spacecraft, during its 1989 flyby, captured dramatic images of Neptune’s deep blue color—although some images were enhanced for clarity. 
        One of Neptune’s most striking features is its extreme weather. 
        The planet is home to the fastest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of over 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour)—up to three times stronger than those on Jupiter and nine times stronger than Earth’s.
